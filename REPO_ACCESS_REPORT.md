# Repo Access Report

Requested repositories:
- https://github.com/bright1122-os/exam-verify-system
- https://github.com/bright1122-os/exam-verify-backend

## Result
I attempted to clone both repositories from this environment but outbound GitHub access is blocked by network policy/proxy.

### Command attempted
`git clone https://github.com/bright1122-os/exam-verify-system /tmp/exam-verify-system`

### Error returned
`fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/bright1122-os/exam-verify-system/': CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`

## Next step
Once network access to GitHub is available (or the repositories are mounted/copied into this workspace), I can read and summarize both codebases in detail.
